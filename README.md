# Why Personal Tutoring

One-on-one tutoring is an efficient and productive method for learning. The learning experience is tailored to the individual. A belief in the ability to master mathematical concepts is a key component to progress. Everyone can learn the material if they believe they can.

My goal when working with a student is to reinforce the lessons as taught in the classroom. Teaching a different technique or method may confuse the student and is only done if there is no better option. Finding the manner in which each individual grasps the material is interesting for me. After working with so many students, I still find each one unique. I learn as much from the students as they do from me! It is a pleasure to see the smile on a student's face when they "get it". After this happens a few times, their confidence increases and math becomes less of a dreaded subject.

I particularly enjoy working with the spectrum of ages from upper elementary, middle and high school as well as older adult college students. Everyone has their strengths which gives the foundation to build upon. Homeschoolers welcome!
Serving areas:
North Westminster, Broomfield, Northglenn, Jefferson County, Adams County, and surrounding areas.
One-on-one coursework

This is the type of student I have most often. When a student knows they have someone with patience to answer their questions, it helps remove the tension and frustration with math in school.

# Test Preparation - Scheduled as needed.

- ACT
- SAT
- GRE
- ... and others

# Course Self-study

Some students wish to learn the course material independently of taking the course. I can help them learn the concepts with the goal of testing out of the class.
